# AccountBook_Website


< My role >
I played the role of implementing board post comment in the reply folder and almost all of a housekeeping book function in household folder.
Also, I had created an AWS server to start the our web service.


< Development environment >
JDK 8.0, Oracle Database 11g, Apache Tomcat 9.0, eclips


If you execute this project, have to do below list.

1. We used oracle 11g xe version as DB. I wrote DB instruction that we used in DB.txt file.
2. In all JSP files, replace 13.209.93.8:8081 with localhost:8081.
   13.209.93.8 is AWS server IP that our team used.
3. Add the library files in the WEB-INF/lib folder to the settings.
